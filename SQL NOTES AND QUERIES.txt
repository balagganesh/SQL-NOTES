SQL : Structred Query Language

It is used to create, maintain and retrieve the relational Database

relational Database means data is stored and retrieved in the form of table. like excel, google spreadsheet ex: MySQL, postgre sql, Oracle.

Non-relational Database is store data in various format like key-value pairs ex: mongodb, DynamoDB.

create database mydb; //database creation

use mydb;

create table employees(employee_id int, first_name varchar(50), last_name varchar(50), salary decimal(5,2), hiring_date date); //create table in mydb database.

select * from employees // display the table

rename table employees to workers  //Rename table

drop table employees //delete employees table

alter table employees add phone_number varchar(20);  //add phone_number column in the table

alter table employees rename column phone_number to mobile_number; //modify the column name

alter table employees modify phone_number varchar(30); //modify the datatype or datatype value

alter table employees modify phone_number varchar(30) after last_name; //modify the column of phone_numner is place after the last_name column

alter table employees drop column phone_number; //drop the column from the table 

insert into employees values (1,"Bala","ganesh",23.30,"2024-07-27"); //insert the data into the table

insert into employees values (2,"siva","kumar",32.20,"2024-08-09"),
							(3,"Pravin","kumar",24.03,"2024-09-12"); // insert multiple value in the table

insert into employees (employee_id,first_name,last_name) values (4,"ganesh","Bala"); //if you want to put the data for specific column use this query 

select first_name , last_name from employees; //display selected column in the table

select * from employees // select all the data in the table

select * from employees where employee_id = 2; //select all the data in employee_id=2 (row)

select * from employees where salary>=24; //who get the salary above 24 it will display all data

select first_name from employees where salary>=24; //who get the salary above 24 it will display the first_name of the table

select * from employees where employee_id != 1; //it doesn't display the employee_id 1 remining data will be display in the table

select * from employees where hiring_date is null; //which data in the hiring_date column is null it will display using this query

select * from employees where hiring_date is not null; //it doesn't display the null column or data..

update employees set salary = 10.23 where employee_id = 4; //update the column data using where clause for identify which column in the table and it also avail in existing data change method
